\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
The modernization of voting systems is an active area in academic research, namely in electronic based systems that can improve upon the traditional paper and pen system that many modern democracies still rely on. This research has been mainly focused in developing systems that verify a finite set of security criteria that are used to infer in the ability of such system to deliver the choice of a voter to a tally authority in a safe, transparent and private fashion.
